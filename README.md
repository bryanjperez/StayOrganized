# Third-Party APIs Challenge: Work Day

In this challenge, I was asked to create a daily planner that provided the user with the current day and time at the top of the calendar. The user was to be presented with time blocks for standard business hours, which I coded as 9am to 5pm. The time blocks were to be color-coded to indicate past, present of future, and the user was to be able to click a time block, enter an event/task, and save it to local storage. The tasks were to persist even when the browser is refreshed.

Below is a screenshot of the deployed applicationL
